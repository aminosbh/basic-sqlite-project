# Basic SQLite project

This project is a basic C [SQLite][] project that uses [CMake][] as a build system.


It could be used as a base for any CMake/SQLite project. Just fork it, clone it
and execute the `rename_project.sh` script. You will be prompted to enter the
new project name, the new executable name and the new git repository, but you
can keep the autodetected values. Finally, just commit and push the result to
your repository.

##Â Overview

This project demonstrates the usage of the SQLite C library. It, first, tries
to open the `users.db` SQLite database, and creates a new one if it does not
yet exists. Then, it creates a `user` table, if it is not already created:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `user` (
    `id`            INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT UNIQUE,
    `first_name`    TEXT NOT NULL,
    `last_name`     TEXT NOT NULL,
    `birthday`      INTEGER,
    `email`         TEXT,
    `password`      TEXT
);
```

After that, it will prompt you to enter the number of users to be added (zero
could be specified). If a positive value is entered, you should specify all
details for each user.

Finally, it will display a table showing the full list of users, but just the
columns `first_name`, `last_name` and `birthday`.

**GUI editor for SQLite databases:**

[DB Brwoser for SQLite][QSLite browser] is recommended for those who would like
to edit their databases and verify that their code is working like they expect.
